# CREDITCARDFRAUDDETECTION
#About

Credit card fraud detection is a critical area in the field of cybersecurity and financial technology. The project focuses on developing algorithms and systems to identify and prevent fraudulent activities related to credit card transactions.

Objective
The primary goal of credit card fraud detection is to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It involves the use of advanced analytics, machine learning, and data science techniques to analyze patterns, anomalies, and trends in credit card transactions.

Key Tasks and Contributions
Imbalanced Data Handling
Recognizing the issue of imbalanced data, we implemented strategies to address this challenge. Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and the use of synthetic data were explored to ensure that the model did not develop a bias towards the majority class.

Binary Classification Model
We focused on developing a powerful binary classification model capable of distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent transactions. Various algorithms, including but not limited to logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, were employed and compared to determine the most effective approach.

Model Evaluation and Metrics
The evaluation of the model was a critical step. Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) were used to assess the model's performance. Given the sensitivity of fraud detection, achieving a balance between precision and recall was of utmost importance.

Repository Structure
